Objective: The goal of this project was to build predictive models to forecast IBM employee attrition and performance.
Models:  Logistic regression analysis, decision trees, and Neural Network models  are used to predict the attrition rate and derive actionable insights at IBM Organization.
Logistic regression: We performed stepwise logistic regression, and the model was found to be significant. From the output, Business Travel, Over Time, Job Involvement, Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, and Job Role as important predictors. 
Training Accuracy: 90.46% ,Validation Accuracy: 88.18%
Decision Tree: We obtained the best results from the decision tree with a maximum of 3 branches. Monthly Income, Over Time, Total Working Years, Job Role, and Stock Options are important variables. Root node split was based on Over Time, 
Misclassification rate of 0.125(validation dataset)
Neural Network: We achieved the best results from the neural network model with default hidden layers.  The model's performance on the validation dataset showed a misclassification rate of 0.10135 and indicating strong predictive capability for employee attrition. 
Training Accuracy: 90.38% , Validation Accuracy: 89.87%
Business Implications: Based on the results, we recommend addressing overtime Concerns, Optimizing Compensation, Workforce Planning and Enhancing  Stock Option Plans majorly and few other concerns can reduce the IBM attrition rate.
